# ME 351: Dynamic Systems – Second-Order System Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing second-order dynamic systems under various damping conditions using both homogeneous and non-homogeneous differential equations. The study applies traditional methods, Laplace transforms, and linear algebra approaches to model system behavior under different force functions and initial conditions.

## Project Scope
The project is divided into two main parts:
- **Homogeneous System Response:** Analysis of system behavior without external forcing functions under different damping conditions.
- **Non-Homogeneous System Response:** Analysis of system response to external forces such as step inputs and sinusoidal inputs.

## Methods Used
- **Traditional Differential Equation Solving**
- **Laplace Transform Techniques**
- **State-Space Representation and Linear Algebra**
- **Numerical Simulations in MATLAB**

## Case Studies
### Homogeneous Systems (f(t) = 0)
- Initial Conditions: x(0) = x₀, ẋ(0) = v₀
- Damping Scenarios:
  - Undamped (ζ = 0)
  - Underdamped (ζ = 0.3)
  - Overdamped (ζ = 1.2)

### Non-Homogeneous Systems
- Case 2: Step Forcing (f(t) = F₀)
- Case 3: Sinusoidal Forcing (f(t) = F₀·cos(ωt))
- Initial Conditions: x(0) = 0, ẋ(0) = 0
- Damping Scenarios:
  - Undamped (ζ = 0)
  - Underdamped (ζ = 0.3)
  - Overdamped (ζ = 1.2)
